Create a secured restful API to create and list articles
- To create an article the user should provide a title, author, the content and date for publishing.
- All of the fields are mandatory and the title should not exceed 100 characters. The publishing date should bind to ISO 8601 format.
- Article results should be paginated.

Additionally, you are required to develop an endpoint for statistics that would be accessible only by admins.
- The endpoint should return count of published articles on daily bases for the 7 days

Please also write tests to verify that your code works
